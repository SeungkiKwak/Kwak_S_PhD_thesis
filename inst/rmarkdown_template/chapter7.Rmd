\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Introduction}

As stated in chapter one, the primary goal of this research was re-evaluating the conventional rice-centered models to better understand the overall pattern of subsistence strategies and assess the weight of rice in it. To achieve this goal the study (1) tests the hypothesis that a wide range of resources were utilized along with rice between 3,400 and 2,000 BP., and (2) establishes a general chronology of subsistence during this period, incorporating in that work the organic geochemical analysis and luminescence dating of the pottery excavated from four large inland habitation sites in the central part of the Korean peninsula. In this last chapter I will review each chapter of this thesis and show how they fulfilled the main goals mentioned above. 

\section{Reprising the work so far}

In chapter one, I briefly reviewed recent approaches to understanding the subsistence change from foragers to farmers. Several underlying characteristics of the places that show the evidences of farming have in common were also mentioned. These characteristics include (1) opportunistic migrations of small group of people, (2) abiguity in the results of genetic studies, and (3) selective adoptation of new subsistence strategies. Then, I elucidated the main purpose of this thesis by narrowing down the region to the central part of the Korean peninsula and addressing current ideas on the role of intensive rice agriculture among the Korean archaeologists. 

In the second chapter, firstly, the general history and social context of Korean archaeology from its beginning stage to the present time was stated especially focusing on the political upheavals such and Japanese annexation of the country and the Korean War. Then, I showed the cultural historical background of the two main prehistoric periods in question: the Chulmun and Mumun periods. After that, I discussed about current views on the transition from foragers to farmers in the Korean peninsula and its main problematic assumption: strict dichotomy between Chulmun hunter-gatherers and Mumun full-dress rice farmers. Lastly, the central hypothesis of this thesis—there was utilization of a wider range of animals and plants resources along with rice among ancient farmers in the central part of the Korean peninsula—was proposed based on the recent scientific evidence from Korea and Europe. 

Chapters three and four were dedicated to the two main analytical methods of this thesis: luminescence dating and the organic geochemical analyses. In these chapters, I discussed about the methodological background, research design and analytical procedure of luminescence dating and the organic geochemical analyses. I briefly outlined history of the two methods in the discipline of archaeology, elucidated the some of the main principles of the methods and emphasize why these two methods are essential to achieve my goal. Also, some of the important implications related to the methods were listed. Lastly, the details about the laboratory experimental procedures were elucidated.    

In the fifth chapter of this thesis, I presented the results of luminescence dating and the organic geochemical analyses on the four inland habitation sites (Sosa-Dong, Kimpo-Yangchon, Songguk-Ri, Eupha-Ri). Firstly, I did the in-depth review of the overall archaeological records of the four sites. Then, the sampling strategies, methods and the results of the organic geochemical analyses and luminescence dating for the each of the sites were elucidated one by one. For the interpretation of the data that produced by the two methods, available archaeological records and radiocarbon dates were incorporated, because this type of scientific research can be strengthen by proper archaeological contextual information.  

In chapter six, I further examined the initial interpretations that I made in the former chapter with the available bulk isotope and paleobotanical data. First, I re-evaluated the current rice-base model and its problematic assumption about the strict dichotomy between Chulmun hunter-gatherers and Mumun full-dress rice farmers by presenting the possibility of continuity between the Chulmun and the Mumun periods. I also tried to interpret the dichotomy/continuity between the Chulmun and Mumun periods with the concept of essentialism versus materialism. Then, by correlating the results of the organic geochemical analyses and luminescence dating with available bulk isotope and paleobotanical data, I suggested continuity of hunting and fishing after the introduction of rice farming. Also, by displaying the relative proportion of C3 plant oil among the entire identified food classes, I emphasized the minor role of rice as a subsistence strategy during the Mumun period. Lastly, I listed some of the important implications of the results in this thesis.

\section{Transition from foraging to farming: Theoratical model vs. Empirical world }

Now I have the results in hand, I will return to the issue raised in chapter 1 of what are the most important factors in explaining the emergence of agriculture. As I mentioned in chapter 1, recent approaches to understanding the subsistence change from foragers to farmers could fall into four categories: (1) population pressure, (2) climatic fluctuation, (3) cultural or social processes, and (4) evolutionary procceses. The population pressure model, climatic fluctutation model, and evolutionary model all assume extenal stresses and emphasize the capacity of farming as a stress reliever. In these models, people use agriculture as a risk-reduction strategy against resource stress driven by evironmental change. In the Korean peninsula, if rice agriculture was used as a risk-reduction strategy, rice should be the mainstay of Korean diet from the Mumun period. However, according to the results of the organic geochemical analyses, hunted wild animals and marine resources were a significant part of the Mumun farmers' day to day foodstuffs. This means the Mumun subsistence pattern does not support those three models. Cultural or social model does not convincingly explain the Mumun subsistence either, for the evidence of conceptual ideas such as new a cosmology, religious practices, symbolic behaviors or wide range of information in relation to rice farming is not clear. 

The transitions from foragers to farmers that occurred around the world had various and diverse pathways and probably cannot be fully explained with a few generalized models. This diversity motivates us to investigate the specific manifestations of this transition in different parts of the world and better understand the different ways that people made this profound transformation. In the prehistoric central Korean peninsula, from the beginning of the Mumun period (c.a. 3,400 BP) we observe the solid evidence of intensive rice farming. However, even after rice farming was introduced, people still relied on hunting and gathering of both terrestrial animals and marine resources. In the central Korean peninsula, indigenous foragers adopted new subsistence strategies little by little for their own purposes [cf. @Crawford2011; @Lee2011b; @Robb2013; @Smith1995; -@Smith2007; -@Smith2011].   


\section{Concluding remarks: The role of intensive rice agriculture as a subsistence strategy in the prehistoric Korean peninsula}

In this thesis I focused on the four inland habitation sites (Sosa-Dong, Kimpo-Yangchon, Songguk-Ri, Eupha-Ri) in the central part of the Korean peninsula, a region that contains a vast amount of archaeological materials related to subsistence change in the deeper past. The aim of this research was re-evaluating the conventional rice-centered models to better understand the overall pattern of subsistence strategies and assess the weight of rice in it. To achieve this goal the study tested the central hypothesis that a wide range of resources were utilized along with rice between 3,400 and 2,000 BP. The results of the organic geochemical analyses on the potsherds from the four sites supported the suggested hypothesis, indicating that most of the pots were used for processing terrestrial animals and marine resources.

In the central Korean peninula, past efforts to reconstruct ancient dietary patterns have been challenged by the high acidity of sediments (RDA 1988). Because of these acidic sediments, the direct examination of the remains of subsistence resources in the Korean peninsula is limited to relatively special locations that provide better preservation of bone or plant remains such as cave, rock-shelters, or shell middens [@Choy2009; -@Choy2010; -@Choy2012]. 

In terms of archaeological records, it is clear that intensive agriculture was practiced in the central part of the Korean peninsula as early as around 3,400 BP [@Lee2003; -@Lee2011b]. Solid evidence of dry fields, irrigated rice paddies and harvesting tools have been found [@Yoon2010]. During this period, many large scale inland habitation sites start to emerge. However, most of these sites did not yield paleobotanical evidence and faunal remains due to post-depositional processes and the high acidity of the archaeological sediments. Due to these conditions, Korean archaeologists have not able to recover detailed information about the diet of ancient Korean farmers, and the main focus has been on harvested crops such as rice [@Kim2006; cf. @Lee2011b]. 

Subsistence changes related to the emergence of agriculture always has been critical part of anthropological debate. This subsistence change was often described as a transition from hunter gathering to intensive agriculture. However, in many areas, scholars have only focused on how quickly or completely people abandoned wild terrestrial and marine resources after the introduction of domesticated plants [cf. @Craig2011]. Once the domesticated plants are introduced, the role of other food resources in ancient farmers’ diet has been neglected. In the Korean archaeology, rice agriculture was often viewed as a cure-all remedy that can substitute any other subsistence strategies after its initial introduction. This overly simplified focus on rice farming blurred the real complexity of the subsistence of the ancient farmers in the prehistoric Korean Peninsula. The possibility of other subsistence strategies in those farmers’ diet, for example, hunting terrestrial animals and procuring aquatic resources, were largely undermined. 

However, the results of organic geochemical analyses and luminescence dating suggested that both terrestrial and aquatic animals were considerable part of the ancient farmers’ diet, well after farming was introduced. It is unquestionable that intensive rice agriculture was practiced in the Korean peninsula as early as 3,400 BP. However, the results of this thesis indicated that there was a wider range of resource utilization and the role of rice was quite limited. What is overlooked in the subsistence studies of the prehistoric Korea is the distinction between the first adoption of crops and the later development of intensive agriculture [@Lee2011b]. The migrants [cf. @Kim2006b], if there were any, probably needed time to adjust themselves to the local environmental conditions, particularly for rice agriculture, which required complicated irrigation techniques and labor intensive effort. Though rice was considered as ‘cure all remedy’ that solves various resources stresses around 3400 BP and additionally argued as a driving factor of the social complexity by the Songguk-Ri stage (Middle Mumun period), it had no more than a minor role as a subsistence strategy throughout the Mumun period.
